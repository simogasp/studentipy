Introduction
------------

A simple script to generate the version of a code to be given to the students.
The script parses the input files and folders and removes/comment the lines tagged
with a special comment tag.
It automatically detects the language.
Folders given in input are recursively parsed.

--------
Requirements
--------

The script has been developed and tested using Python 2 (>=2.7).

--------
Usage
--------

```shell
studentify.py input [input ...] [-o OUTPUT]
```
The script will remove/comment/replace any line from the original input files
that ends with a particular comment tag.

In a C file, the usable tags are:

* Deleting tags: these tags remove the line(s) of code in the student version.
	* `//!!` : inline delete tag: this line will be removed
	* `//<!!` : start block delete tag: all lines will be removed until end tag
	* `//>!!` : end block delete tag: end the delete block

* Commenting tags: these tags comment out the line(s) of code in the student version.
	* `//??` : inline comment tag: this line will be commented
	* `//<??` : start block comment tag: all lines will be commented until end tag
	* `//>??` : end block comment tag: end the comment block

* Student tags: 
	* `//::` : inline student tag: keep line in student mode but delete in clean mode
	* `//<::` : start block student tag
	* `//>::` : end block student tag

* Replacing tags: these tags replace the line(s) with alternative code in the student version.
	* `//++` : inline replacing tag: remove the code before the tag and replace it with what comes after the tag
	* `//<++` : start block replacing tag
	* `//>++` : end block replacing tag

In other supported languages, just change the `//` (C comment style)
by the comment of the language (`%` in matlab, `#` in python, ...).
The supported languages are:

| Language   | Comment symbol | deleting tag | commenting tag | student tag | replacing tag |
| ---------- | -----------    | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| c/c++      |    `//`        |    `//!!`    |    `//??`      |    `//::`   |    `//++`     |
| javascript |    `//`        |    `//!!`    |    `//??`      |    `//::`   |    `//++`     |
| java       |    `//`        |    `//!!`    |    `//??`      |    `//::`   |    `//++`     |
| matlab     |    `%`         |    `%!!`     |    `%??`       |    `%::`    |    `%++`      |
| python     |    `#`         |    `#!!`     |    `#??`       |    `#::`    |    `#++`      |


For example in the following piece of code:

```c
// example of deleting tag
normal line
inline delete //!!
normal line
start delete block //<!!
normal line
end delete block //>!!

// example of commenting tag
normal line
inline comment //??
normal line
start comment block //<??
normal line
end comment block //>??

// example of student tag
normal line
// inline student //::
normal line
// start student block //<::
normal line
// end student block //>::

// example of replacing tag
normal line
line that changes //++ line visible to student // why not a comment here
normal line
first line to change //<++ first
second line to change // second
third line to change  // third
fourth line to change //>++ fourth
```

will be transformed by the command `studentify.py the_c_file` into:

```c
// example of deleting tag
normal line

normal line




// example of commenting tag
normal line
// inline comment
normal line
// start comment block
// normal line
// end comment block

// example of student tag
normal line
// inline student
normal line
// start student block
normal line
// end student block

// example of replacing tag
normal line
line visible to student // why not a comment here
normal line
first
second
third
fourth
```

And by the command `studentify.py the_c_file --clean` into:

```c
// example of deleting tag
normal line
inline delete
normal line
start delete block
normal line
end delete block

// example of commenting tag
normal line
inline comment
normal line
start comment block
normal line
end comment block

// example of student tag
normal line

normal line




// example of replacing tag
normal line
line that changes
normal line
first line to change
second line to change
third line to change
fourth line to change
```

To have a complete list of the functionalities available,
just print the help of the command with:

```shell
studentify.py -h
```
